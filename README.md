# Architectural Support to Performance-targeted Continuous Software Engineering: a Mapping Study

In this paper we present a mapping study of the existing literature, where we aim at investigating the contribution given up today by the scientific community to the exploitation of architectural support to the software development aimed at satisfying performance requirements, within a continuous software engineering paradigm.

## Selection process

After performing the automated search on digital libraries, we merged the obtained results and then removed duplicates, obtaining 159 papers. After that, we selected papers with respect to the selection criteria. In particular, for screening the publications, we defined the following exclusion criteria:

- is a book chapter
- is a secondary or tertiary study (survery, SLR, SMS, ...)
- not about continuous engineering/devops practices
- not about software performance
- not about software architecture
- not in the software engineering area
- not in English

After the application of those criteria, we obtained 71 papers.

Finally, we deeply analyzed each paper and excluded further 17 papers as they were not compliant with our mapping study context. As minor refinement, in this step, we discarded also papers that showed low quality. Finally, we obtained 54 selected papers ([Primary studies](./primary_studies.md)).

## Results of the Mapping

[Dataset](./dataset.md) depicts the results of our mapping study for each of the above mentioned categories, by reporting the number of primary studies classified with respect to each keyword. We also show the variation of this mapping over the years.
