# Architectural Support to Performance-targeted Continuous Software Engineering: a Mapping Study

In this paper we present a mapping study of the existing literature, where we aim at investigating the contribution given up today by the scientific community to the exploitation of architectural support to the software development aimed at satisfying performance requirements, within a continuous software engineering paradigm.

## Selection process

After performing the automated search on digital libraries, we merged the obtained results and then removed duplicates, obtaining 159 papers. After that, we selected papers with respect to the selection criteria. In particular, for screening the publications, we defined the following exclusion criteria:

- is a book chapter
- is a secondary or tertiary study (survery, SLR, SMS, ...)
- not about continuous engineering/devops practices
- not about software performance
- not about software architecture
- not in the software engineering area
- not in English

After the application of those criteria, we obtained 71 papers.

Finally, we deeply analyzed each paper and excluded further 17 papers as they were not compliant with our mapping study context. As minor refinement, in this step, we discarded also papers that showed low quality. Finally, we obtained 54 selected papers ([Primary studies](./primary_studies.md)).

## Results of the Mapping

[Dataset](./dataset.md) depicts the results of our mapping study for each of the above mentioned categories, by reporting the number of primary studies classified with respect to each keyword. We also show the variation of this mapping over the years.

### Research focus

#### Reseach Area

[Research area](./research-area.md) describes the principal area of interest in which the primary studies contribute to (note that, each study may contribute to more than one area).

#### Target problem

[Target problem](./target-problem.md) deals with the problems targeted by the primary studies.

#### Application domain

[Application domain](./application-domain.md) covers specific field of application.  

#### Research contributions

[Research contributions](./research-contribution.md) From our analysis, we can state that most of the studies contribute to the research domain with Performance analysis, Performance modelling, and Performance prediction approaches.

### Characteristics of approaches

#### Methodologies and techniques
[Methodologies and techniques](./methodologies-techniques.md) shows the results for the Methodologies and techniques. Most approaches use well-assessed techniques like Performance models and Performance analysis. 

#### Performance measures and indices

[Performance measures and indices](./performance-indices.md) shows the results obtained in the category Performance measures and indices. The most used performance index is \emph{Response time}; this result is likely related to the system domain the studies belong to.

#### Types of data

[Types of data](./types-data.md) depicts the {Types of data} exploited in our primary studies. Most of them are due to Monitored and Runtime/Real-time data.


#### Mapping variation

[Mapping variation](./mapping-variation.md) reports the average variation of mapping over the years (i.e., before and after 2015).
